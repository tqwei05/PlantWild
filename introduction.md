**Sign language translation (SLT)** aims to convert a continuous sign language video clip into a spoken language. 
Considering different geographic regions generally have their own native sign languages, it is valuable to establish corresponding SLT datasets to support related communication and research. 
Auslan, as a sign language specific to Australia, still lacks a dedicated large-scale dataset for SLT.
To fill this gap, we curate an Australian Sign Language translation dataset, dubbed Auslan-Daily, which is collected from the Auslan educational TV series and Auslan TV programs.
