Existing plant disease classification models have achieved remarkable performance in recognizing in-laboratory diseased images. However, their performance often significantly degrades in classifying in-the-wild images. Furthermore, we observed that in-the-wild plant images may exhibit similar appearances across various diseases (i.e., small inter-class discrepancy) while the same diseases may look quite different (i.e., large intra-class variance). Motivated by this observation, we propose an in-the-wild multimodal plant disease recognition dataset that contains the largest number of disease classes but also text-based descriptions for each disease.
