**PlantWild Dataset** 

Current plant disease classification models excel in identifying diseased images under controlled, laboratory conditions. However, their performance significantly declines when applied to real-world, in-the-wild images. 
We observed that in-the-wild plant images often have a small inter-class discrepancy, meaning different diseases may look similar, and a large intra-class variance, where the same disease can appear quite different.
To address this, we propose an in-the-wild multimodal plant disease recognition dataset. This dataset, the largest of its kind, includes numerous disease classes and provides text descriptions for each disease. 
These text descriptions enrich the dataset with valuable textual information, aiding in tackling the challenges of small inter-class discrepancy and large intra-class variance in real-world disease classification.
