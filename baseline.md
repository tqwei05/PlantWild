Code of our baseline MVPDR is available through [MVPDR](https://github.com/tqwei05/MVPDR).
The workflow of MVPDR is presented as the following figure.
It models text descriptions and visual data through multiple prototypes and can achieve outstanding performance on in-the-wild plant disease images.

As the pre-trained Vision-Language model CLIP is leveraged and textual prompts of each class are provided,
MVPDR can not only classify diseases but also recognize diseases in few-shot or training-free scenarios.
